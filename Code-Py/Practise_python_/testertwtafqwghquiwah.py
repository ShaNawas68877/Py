Everything around me covered by snow
I see ants moving in the line
No disturbance in their flow

I am freezing slowly to die
My throat is paining, I can't cry
No help from nowhere, I can expect
This is going to be my last moment

The entire desert got covered by the white blanket
Everything is still, I can see no movement
My thoughts are going to freeze
If anyone's out there, help me please

But no help is going to come
And I'm not going home!
For no body can read my thoughts
Yes, I have been calling through my thoughts

Warm rays of heat hit my face
Slowly I lift my head, to see sunrise
I am not dead yet, I just realize
My hope is back, there's a chance

To carve my name in the history
One day, Children will read my story
That day is not so far away
All I have to do is to be steadfast in my way"""

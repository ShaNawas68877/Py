1)'''past , present and future... India was ruled by many kingdoms , British,
etc over centuries ... But we can't move towards development if we talk about what rajputs did or Mughals did or
British did or anybody else in the extreme past ...'''

Bro, No one is talking about extreeeme past, Hassan is only talking about 1947 and slightly before that moment.
I don't think anyone would consider that as extreeeme past

2)"But we can't move towards development if we talk about what rajputs did or Mughals did or British did or anybody else in the extreme past ..."

Why not? Surely, not every single individual is going to talk only about past for their entire life, if that is the case, then yes it might affect our development
but here we are trying to talk about past which serves as the root of the current problem
For better understanding, consider it as a medical history to diagnose and treat a current disease

3)"Rather it would be best if we talk about evolving solar power in India, recent ban on plastics, nuclear power, new space developments, technology, etc ... Or in short , whats happening now only matters"

We need to have a balanced society, whoever loves solar power stuff etc, let them talk about it and work towards it, we are not forcing them not to talk technology
But whoever cares about human rights, oppression, tyranny, politics, history, let them talk about it, if you dont like that, i hope no one invited you!

4)"whats happening now only matters"
How so?


5)"Regarding grabbing books , I would rather choose books that educate me with moral values, technology or any kind that would lead me to mental or physical development ....
And hopefully contribute good to the society rather than even having a look at negativity and spread hatred..."

Moral values and technology?? I suppose you were discussing about Geo-political issue, how moral values, technology, mental or
physical development even matters with the geo-political issue, please do enlighten me, would much appreciate it!
Again, fighting against injustice for human rights and lives of innocent human beings is also a contribution to the society,
a much greater contribution, even if it is educating people about the actual issue, who only cares about their mental and physical development

6)"who told there was no India ... Wrong info bro... Plus talking of rape .. who gave u this info ? Any history book?"
And for Ur kind information ... Before being India .. the name of this place was Hindustan...Kashmir is being funded and safeguarded by India ... So it's their duty to respect it and not throw stones or in short piss on the same plate they eat....

[Contradicts 1st comment (many small kingdoms)] There was no India, its a fact, But if you mean the physical land, yes there was, but not how it is today, the imaginary lines on the map!
For your kind information, before being India or Hindustan, it was known as Indus valley civilisation or Harappan civilisation, even before that it would have been known with a different name, if we are going to check the previous names why should we stop with 1947. Lets go back a bit further!
Like wise with the name Allahabad, why should we stop with 1575 name, lets go back even further, it would have been known with a different name

7)"Every state is facing one or the other problem.. in my perspective , every state is also developing in some other areas ... It's better to look at the positives and move forward .."

sure, but no state has military forces out of their homes, if you say Kashmir is a border, i remind you that Kashmir is not the only border

8)".Kashmir is being funded and safeguarded by India ... So it's their duty to respect it and not THROW STONES"

Yes, those who take slaves also, feed the slaves and safeguard them, doesnt mean they care about them
If the people were treated in a humane way, no, they will not THROW STONES


9)"the kids u r mentioning r well trained to fire bullets at the army ..."

Bro, there is a typo, its not "fire bullets" but "THROW STONES", refer your previous comment

10)"How long can u just cry over Islamic news that focus only on killings, rape, torture, etc... Look around u. . do u find any? "

Yes, Many!

11)"Do u know what is the meaning of independence and democracy. U can stay in your country and can speak against it ... Noone bats an eye.. however u can't compare it with stone pelting .. can anyone do it in Pakistan or any other country?"

Oh, no we are not speaking against country just against the politicians, just against this single issue as of now! Even in a pure democracy, there are only few things that you can speak against!
Stone pelting, yes, the real question is why are they throwing stones, knowing that they would get pellet guns to lose their sight, think about it

12)"Our country is very beautiful with enough opportunities for development ..."

Absolutely, but the problem is the politicians, its fine even if they stop stealing resources, but many go beyond to spark communal riots, eg: Gujarat, Bonus info: Na Mo was CM


13)"U question that how good things can happen without solving Kashmir issue... if it's so , India won't have proud souls like Sir Abdul Kalam to give u an example .""

Sorry to say this, but this is the dumbest comment i have seen in a really long time, why dumbest? because APJ Abdul Kalam has absolutely nothing to do with Kashmir, (The Non-Sequitor of the century)
If he was born in Kashmir, he could have been shot dead by our army long ago or would have lost his sight to pellet guns


14)"....If I give u money to throw stones at army... Will u ?

Thats a very huge false accusation, any authentic academic sources to back your claim? In other terms, History!

15)"And if u do that for money , r u a true indian?"

This statement is another sad irony, you said 'look around you, do you find any?' for the killings, rape and torture
but now, look around you, do you find anyone uploading the pictures of getting money to throw stones and get bullets instead?


16)"And the army protecting us write INDIAN as their religion ... They guard us ..that's why we can sleep , eat or are able to talk like this in full freedom ."

yes, that is what the army of all the countries do, that is their basic responsibiity, that is why we pay taxes and they get salary, apartments, and tons of other stuffs.
its a great job for sure, so is other jobs!


17)"Talking of rape ... Points r really irrelevant... Talk about the Mughal rulers.. they were the ones who bought the rape culture ... Raping and converting Hindu Princess and women into Muslims.... 
Regarding Allahabad... The name was changed into Allahabad from prayaga in 1575.... So if it's changed again. Back to original . Whats the problem? "

you considered 1947 as extreme past, but now you have gone to 1575. WoW
You said lets not talk about Rajputs and Mughals, yet you are the one talking about Mughals

Another HUGE FALSE ACCUSATION

any authentic academic sources to justify the statement that Mughals brought rape culture would be much appreciated




'''
18)It's how u think that matters .... Noone else would judge u .. or me ... My point is if u keep on thinking and fill Ur mind with all this , do u think people would appreciate u ? 
    I have a few set of questions for u to ask yourself bro ..
    1. Who told u , u r muslim or I am hindu ? Aren't we humans first ?
    2. Dr. Abdul Kalam ... We refer to him as a scientist and a good human being ... Not as a Muslim ... 
    At the same time , abdul Kasab... We refer as a terrorist .. again not a Muslim ... 
    3. Bro , if a person needs blood at hospital, does he confirm the religion of the doner ?
    4. Who gave that religion branding ?'''

You said you are not judging, but that is exactly what you have done

All these questions are LOADED QUESTIONS (read about arguments), it doesnot matter what we answer, the questions are to corner someone
Whatever they answer, the conclusion would be more or less the same


19)"army is standing at border to take bullets to safeguard Kashmir "

Exactly, thats our point, to save kashmir not the kashmiris. Trust me there is a huge difference


20)"If u talk about 70 years of this issue , I talk about 70 years of tolerance by the army too. ..."

who were they tolerating and why? What was their crimes except being born to a kashmiri muslim?


21)'''
... go and stand in border for a day , protect the country , go to Syria and help those people, etc Commenting on FB won't help ...
'''

You said that you are not associated with any party or politics in the next comment which contradicts this, because you chant the same mantra of the party who always say The same old claim 'go stand in the border' to move forward their political agenda


22)"The way u think now will propel u to be the person in Ur future"

That is why we care about history

23)"U were better than this bro"

This statement reminds me of Shakespears quote, 'everyones good until you expect something from them' (Paraphrased)
or i would say, "Everyone would like you until you like what they like"

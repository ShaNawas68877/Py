       #Hint: To complete this exercise you will need to extract individual characters
                #from the two-character note name so that you can work with the letter and theoctavenumberseparately.Onceyouhaveseparatedtheparts,computethe frequency of
                #the note in the fourth octave using the data in the table above. Then divide the frequency by 24âˆ’x, where x is the octave number entered by the user.
                #This will halve or double the frequency the correct number of times.
p = int(n[1:])  #It holds the integer of the note
if p > 8:
    print('Wrong note : Error')
d = t / 2**(4-p)    # This calculates the notes frequency by taking middle values i.e, 4 values
print(d)
#print(t)
#print(p)
#print(s)
